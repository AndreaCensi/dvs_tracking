The DVS attaches to a computer using a common USB port.
 The camera is distributed with a portable software framework written in
 Java called jAER

 This project, developed in C++ for maximum efficiency, needed a special
 driver to be developed, based on the Thesycon USB device driver

 The events are transmitted from the camera in packets of up to several
 hundred events; however, each event is independently tagged at the source
 with its proper timestamp.

 Since we wanted to implement our approach in C++ due to performance and
 portability considerations (e.g.
 to embedded systems) it was necessary to write a driver interface to the
 DVS first.
 Thesycon

, the provider of the USB device driver, already offers a framework to communica
te with their driver.
 This was employed to pull the event data from the DVS.
 Similar to jAER, the events are wrapped up in packets of several events.
 The packet size depends on the chunk of data which arrives at once from
 the USB.
 This not only makes sense as the data arrive in chunks of up to several
 hundred events from the USB buffer; packet-based processing is furthermore
 advantageous for certain operations, e.g.
 if they are computationally costly and single events do not provide enough
 relevant information to be processed individually.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although a less powerful microprocessor would have been sufficient, a high
 number of independent Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) drivers was an important
 property in order to drive several LEDs with different frequencies.
 The bronze board has 7 PWM drivers, from which 5 are free to use.
\end_layout

\end_inset

We used infrared LEDs since the DVS is very sensitive in the infrared spectrum.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An already existing C code example was taken and adapted to our needs.
 Additionally, a python script provided the means of remotely adjusting
 the PWM via USB.
 The choice of LEDs was important, since they should be well visible.
 The ideal LED for our project would provide high illuminance and a wide
 emission angle.

We decided to attach four LEDs to our quadrotor which is the minimum number
 to estimate the pose in 3D space.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our setup we could easily change the PWM frequency to the LEDs.
 An upper bound on the detectable frequency depends on the power of the
 LEDs and the distance to the camera; a DVS camera is not magic: there must
 be a large enough change in the number of photons reaching the photoreceptor
 to trigger an event.
 In our setup we found 2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

KHz to be an adequate number.
 The frequencies for each LEDs were then decided in the interval 1--2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

KHz making sure we did not choose frequencies with common harmonics.
 A reasonable lower bound on the blinking frequency was found experimentally
 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

KHz to minimize the confusion between with background motion (see

KHz.
 There is a different number of P and N events, which tells us that we cannot
 really interpret the DVS data as simply the derivative of the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this particular data, the P events arrive noisily, while the N events
 arrive more regularly.
 Note that the what we observe here is the combination of the LED dynamics
 with the dynamics of the photoreceptor and the nonlinear detector.
 Experimentally we found that the interval between successive P/N transitions
 is very repeatable: we have observed that the jitter is well approximated
 by a Gaussian with standard deviation equal to

 Note in (c) that the motion of the camera creates apparent motion of the
 environment and a large number of events; however they are of a low frequency.
 In this case, the events from the background are negligible after

 of the motion.
 We can choose the frequencies of the markers high enough such that they
 are not confused as background motion.

Things get more complicated when the camera is moving, because the apparent
 motion of the environment creates changes in luminance that are unrelated
 to the

 However, we have found that we can discriminate between the two types of
 events based on their temporal statistics.

a moving camera with no LEDs.
 From this data we can see that the motion of the camera generates a large
 number of events, but at low frequencies, and notwithstanding the motion,
 we can still see very clearly the peaks originated from the markers.
 Therefore, if we choose the marker frequencies high enough, we can filter
 for the camera motion just by ignoring the events corresponding to frequencies
 under a certain threshold.
