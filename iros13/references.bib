@BOOK{gower04procrustes,
  title = {Procrustes problems},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2004},
  author = {John C. Gower and Garmt B. Dijksterhuis},
  volume = {30},

  address = {Oxford, UK},
  abstract = {First systematic overview of Procrustean methods in one volume Multi-disciplinary
	- these matching methods are used in many fields involving data analysis
	at research level Contains new algorithms Presents a unifying ANOVA
	framework Procrustean methods are used to transform one set of data
	to represent another set of data as closely as possible. The name
	derives from the Greek myth where Procrustes invited passers-by in
	for a pleasant meal and a night's rest on a magical bed that would
	exactly fit any guest. He then either stretched the guest on the
	rack or cut off their legs to make them fit perfectly into the bed.
	Theseus turned the tables on Procrustes, fatally adjusting him to
	fit his own bed. This text, the first monograph on Procrustes methods,
	unifies several strands in the literature and contains much new material.
	It focuses on matching two or more configurations by using orthogonal,
	projection and oblique axes transformations. Group-average summaries
	play an important part and links with other group-average methods
	are discussed. This is the latest in the well-established and authoritative
	Oxford Statistical Science Series, which includes texts and monographs
	covering many topics of current research interest in pure and applied
	statistics. Each title has an original slant even if the material
	included is not specifically original. The authors are leading researchers
	and the topics covered will be of interest to all professional statisticians,
	whether they be in industry, government department or research institute.
	Other books in the series include 23. W.J.Krzanowski: Principles
	of multivariate analysis: a user's perspective updated edition 24.
	J.Durbin and S.J.Koopman: Time series analysis by State Space Models
